The good and at the same time bad thing about being a software engineer in the startup era is that a lot of people want to sell you 
their great idea to get one of those millions that the startups are getting so "easily" and you *need* to help them.
Since a lot of the rockstar startups were made of simple ideas like WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram and so on, some people tend to think
that an idea is all that is needed, which couldn't be more away from the truth.
