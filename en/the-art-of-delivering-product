The good and at the same time bad thing about being a software engineer in the startup era is that a lot of people want to sell you 
their great idea to get one of those millions that the startups are getting so "easily" and you *need* to help them.
Since a lot of the rockstar startups were made of simple ideas like WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram and so on, some people tend to think
that an idea is all that is needed, which couldn't be more away from the truth.

Last week a friend asked for a meeting because he wanted to talk about an big idea that was *Insert your big idea here*. He kept saying
that everyone whose he had talked about told that his idea was great and he could make a lot of money from it. When he finished I had to
agree, the idea was good.
