The good and at the same time bad thing about being a software engineer in the startup era is that a lot of people want to sell you 
their great idea to get one of those millions that the startups are getting so "easily" and you *need* to help them.
Since a lot of the rockstar startups were made of simple ideas like WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram and so on, some people tend to think
that an idea is all that is needed, which couldn't be more away from the truth.

Last week a friend asked for a meeting because he wanted to talk about an big idea that was *Insert your big idea here*. He kept saying
that everyone whose he had talked about told that his idea was great and he could make a lot of money from it. When he finished I had to
agree, the idea was good.

Now let's make some things clear, the final idea was good. The final product could be a good one and it well created and the proccess
well executed could make its owner rich, but again, it is not only about the idea.

When I started the real questions things got a little hot.

1. Do you have the money to make all of it?
2. How do you plan to enter in the market?

And last but not less important

3. Do you really need *EVERYTHING* of the final product to start it?

I always let the last question for the final because:

1. The first one isn't idea related, is about the money you think you are going to spend to make it happen.
2. The second one dictates what you need done to start
3. Here everything changes because of lack of knowledge or market study a lot of people think that a product in the market
is always very well done and polished which most of the time is not the case.
