The good and at the same time bad thing about being a software engineer in the information era is that a lot of people want you to validate their big idea. Which almost always is for of course get one of those millions that the startups are getting so *easily*. Since a lot of the rockstar startups were created upon simple ideas like WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram and so on, some people tend to believe that a thinking is all that is needed to have success, which couldn't be more away from the truth.

Last week a friend asked me for a meeting because he wanted to talk about a big idea that was *Insert your big idea here*. He kept saying that everyone whose he had talked about told that it was great and he could make a lot of money from it. There he convinced me, the idea was good.

Now let's make some things clear, the final product that he had in mind cound be good **if** and only if it was well created and the proccess well executed. He could get rich, but again, it is not only about the idea itself.

When I started the real questions things got a little hot.

1. Do you have the money to build all of it?
  For lack of proper knowledge some people tend to believe that a piece of software is cheap. They forgot that developers need to be paid and it has some costs like servers, email services, merchandising and so on. 
2. How do you plan to enter in the market?

And last but not less important

3. Do you really need *EVERYTHING* of the final product to start it?

I always let the last question for the final because:

1. The first one isn't idea related, is about the money you think you are going to spend to make it happen.
2. The second one dictates what you need done to start
3. Here everything changes because of lack of knowledge or market study a lot of people think that a product in the market
is always very well done and polished which most of the time is not the case.
