The good and at the same time bad thing about being a software engineer in the information era is that a lot of people want you to validate their big idea. Which almost always is for of course get one of those millions that the startups are getting so *easily*. Since a lot of the rockstar startups were created upon simple ideas like WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram and so on, some people tend to believe that a thinking is all that is needed to have success, which couldn't be more away from the truth.

Last week a friend asked me for a meeting because he wanted to talk about a big idea that was *Insert your big idea here*. He kept saying that everyone whose he had talked about told that it was great and he could make a lot of money from it. There he convinced me, the idea was good.

Now let's make some things clear, the final product that he had in mind cound be good **if** and only if it was well created and the proccess well executed. He could get rich, but again, it is not only about the idea itself.

When I started the real questions things got a little hot.

1. Do you have the money to build all of it?

  For lack of proper knowledge some people tend to believe that a piece of software is cheap. They forgot that developers need to be paid as well as other things like servers, email services, merchandising and so on.

  A recurring thing is that if you have an idea someone is going to put their money on it. If you check most of the startup pitch presentations you are going to see that most of the time the investiment is made in the person/execution and that the idea is just something in the middle. 
  
2. How do you plan to enter in the market?

  For some people it is hard to believe, but an application doesn't just appear in front of the end user and he loves it. It needs to appear somewere, someone needs to say that it is good. A software that isn't seen by the people who may want it is not going to be used by the ones who doesn't even know that it exists.
  
3. Do you really need *EVERYTHING* of the final product to validate your idea?
